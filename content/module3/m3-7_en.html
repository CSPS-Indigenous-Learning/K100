	<p>While the arbitrary practice of taking Indigenous children from their families and adopting them out came to a halt in the 1980s, there continue to be major concerns. The <strong>child welfare system</strong> affects more Indigenous children today than did the Indian Residential Schools and the Sixties Scoop combined. </p>
	<p>According to the 2016 Census, Indigenous children represent only 7.7% of the total population aged 0 to 14 in Canada. However, they account for 52.2% of children in foster care.

	<p>The impacts of over-representation in the child welfare system—which include <a href="#glossaryIntergenerationalTrauma" class="csps-glossary" data-effect="mfp-zoom-in">intergenerational trauma</a> —have yet to be addressed. In some areas, Indigenous agencies have been set up to manage within their communities the child and family welfare according to their own values. However, the problem continues because adequate resources are needed to heal the ongoing cycles of abuse and removal to tackle the root issues of colonization and discriminatory policies.</p>
