	<p>The <a href='#' data-ext="wb-ext-35" class="external"><em>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</em></a> is an international human rights instrument. It states that the rights contained within it “constitute the minimum standards for the survival, dignity and well-being of the indigenous people of the world.”</p>
	<p>After over two decades of negotiations, the United Nations General Assembly adopted this declaration in September 2007. A majority of 144 countries were in favour. However, 4 countries voted against it—Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States—and 11 others abstained. Canada did not adopt the UN Declaration at that time, which it believed would conflict with the <em>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</em>.</p>
	<p>After years of review and reflection, Canada reversed its position on May 10, 2016. The Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs announced Canada’s full support:</p>
	<blockquote class="h4" align="center"><strong>&ldquo;We intend nothing less than to adopt and implement the declaration in accordance with the Canadian Constitution.&rdquo;</strong></blockquote>

	<p><em>The United Nations Declaration</em> describes the individual and collective rights of Indigenous peoples around the world:</p>
	<ul>
		<li> It offers guidance on cooperative relationships with Indigenous peoples based on the principles of equality, partnership, good faith and mutual respect</li>
		<li> It addresses the rights of Indigenous peoples on issues such as culture, identity, religion, language, health, education and community</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This declaration has a direct impact on the policies and programs of the Government of Canada. As a public service employee, you will need to closely watch its unfolding impacts.</p>
