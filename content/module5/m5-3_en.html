<div class="col-md-6">
	<p>As you have seen, the relationship between the Government of Canada and First Nations, Métis and Inuit has a complex history. It is likely not what you were taught in school.</p>
	<p>The Government of Canada has decided that our laws and policies need to be reviewed:</p>
	<ul>
		<li> to recognize the <strong>unique place that Indigenous peoples have</strong> in the Canadian political and constitutional framework</li>
		<li> to be <strong>inclusive</strong> as set out in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</li>
	</ul>

	<p>As public service employees, we are being asked:</p>
	<ul>
		<li> to take a broader perspective</li>
		<li> to reflect on our blind spots</li>
		<li> to do our part in renewing and advancing the relationship with Indigenous peoples</li>
