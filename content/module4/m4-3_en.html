	<p>The Government of Canada has frequently been found guilty of breaching treaty obligations by the courts. The court cases were the first step in a long process that has led to today’s modern treaties, also known as comprehensive claims agreements.</p>
	<p><strong>Land claims</strong> generally arise in areas of Canada where <strong>Indigenous land rights have not been dealt with by treaty </strong>or other legal means. In these areas, forward-looking comprehensive claims agreements are negotiated between Indigenous groups and the federal, provincial and territorial governments. They are implemented through legislation and they remain the most comprehensive way of addressing Indigenous rights and title. Some of these treaties have also included provisions relating to self-government.</p>
	<p>Since 1973, the Government of Canada and its negotiation partners have signed 26 comprehensive land claims and 4 self-government agreements. Today, modern treaties cover over 40% of Canada’s land mass. They include Government of Canada obligations such as hiring a certain number of people from the treaty area, or contracting to local companies. Some have even involved foreign trade. </p>
