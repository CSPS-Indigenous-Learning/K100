<h1>Chapter 3: Impacts of colonialism</h1>
<p>Our aim is to help you understand the <strong>negative effects</strong> of government decisions on First Nations, Métis and Inuit. It’s a first step in building more <strong>positive relationships </strong>with Indigenous people in the work that you do. As you read this chapter, you may feel some emotions of shame, frustration and sadness. It’s normal. Be kind to yourself. If you require support, please reach out to someone:</p>
