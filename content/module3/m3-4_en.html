		<p>In 1927, <strong>Dr. Peter Bryce</strong>, Chief Medical Officer at the <a href="#glossaryDIA" class="csps-glossary">Department of Indian Affairs</a>, was asked to investigate the conditions of Indian Residential Schools. He found many problems, such as overcrowding, poor nutrition and abuse. He wrote up a report about the conditions and provided recommendations.</p>
		<p>As Dr. Peter Bryce stated:</p>
		<blockquote class="h5" align="center">It suffices for us to know… that of a total of 1,537 pupils reported upon nearly 25 per cent are dead, of one school with an absolutely accurate statement, 69 per cent of ex-pupils are dead, and that everywhere the almost invariable cause of death given is tuberculosis. <footer> Bryce 1907, 18</footer></blockquote>

		<p>The Department recognized that the children lost their natural resistance to illness by living closely together in the residential schools—and that they died at a much higher rate than they would have, had they been living with their families and in their own communities. However, Dr. Bryce’s report was ignored, and he was removed from his position.</p>
		<p class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-2 col-md-12 col-md-offset-0 circle-bundle journal"><strong>Self-reflection: Why do you think Dr. Bryce was removed from his position? After this report, how could the Government of Canada continue running Indian Residential Schools for another 69 years?</strong></p>
