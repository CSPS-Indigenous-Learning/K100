<p>This course provided an overview of the historical relationship between Indigenous peoples and the Government of Canada. Our future will be a reconciled one if each and every public service employee takes the matter in their own hands by taking action to understand. Start by learning more - every part of Canada has Indigenous communities and organizations - look around to see what is available!</p>
<p>As you know, there are three distinct Indigenous groups: First Nations, Métis and Inuit. Each group is very distinct and has been impacted differently by the Government of Canada’s actions and decisions. The next courses will explore these groups in more detail.</p>
