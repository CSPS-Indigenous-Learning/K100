<div class="col-md-6">
	<p>Treaties signed between two nations were historically the preferred way to establish relationships. As a result of these treaties—from the Peace and Friendship Treaties in the Maritimes to today’s comprehensive land claims and self-government agreements—much of Canada's land mass is covered by these treaties dated prior to 1975. Parts of British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec are exceptions.</p>

	<p>Treaties were the <strong>way the Crown gained control over territory</strong> without having to fight or conquer the First Nations and Inuit who occupied the land. Many of the treaties were intended to simplify the migration of Europeans and establish military or trade alliances. In return, the chiefs and their communities received various &ldquo;promises&rdquo; (each treaty is different and unique). In some cases, treaties included the surrender of title to the land. In many others, it meant sharing access to land. </p>
	<p>There was no<strong> mutual understanding</strong> of what was included in the treaties. Sometimes the languages used between the parties were different. Given the Government of Canada’s dominant position, its interpretation was enforced over the years. This means that First Nations leaders didn’t always understand what they were signing because the meaning was lost in translation.</p>
