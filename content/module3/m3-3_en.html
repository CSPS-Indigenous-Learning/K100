  <h1>Indian Residential Schools</h1>

<div class="col-md-6">
  <p>The first Indian Residential School in our country dates back to 1828. The last school closed in 1996. About 130 residential schools were located across the country. To see if a residential school existed in your community, you can refer to the Indian Residential Schools of Canada <a href='#' data-ext="wb-ext-8" class="external">historical map</a>.</p>
  <p>In 1920, the <em>Indian Act</em> was amended to give the Government of Canada more power to take away the status of Indians against their will. The Deputy Superintendent responsible for the Residential School system explained the purpose of the amendment.</p>
  <blockquote>&ldquo;Our objective is to continue until there is not a single Indian in Canada that has not been absorbed into the body politic, and there is no Indian question, and no Indian Department, that is the whole object of this Bill.&rdquo;</blockquote>
  <p>The objective of the Residential School system was to <strong>forcefully and aggressively assimilate </strong>children into a culture based on a European approach to governance, language, education, religion and family. The Government of Canada felt justified to &ldquo;kill the Indian in the child&rdquo; in order to integrate First Nations, MÃ©tis and Inuit into the newly formed country.</p>

    <h2>Harmful outcome</h2>
  <p>Residential schools destroyed the lives of over <strong>150,000 children.</strong> At the same time, these schools systematically undermined Indigenous culture, disrupted families for generations and contributed to a general loss of language, culture and identity.</p>
  <p>Indigenous children:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>were often isolated from their communities</li>
    <li>grew up without experiencing a nurturing family life</li>
    <li>lost their language and could no longer speak with their parents and other family members</li>
  </ul>
