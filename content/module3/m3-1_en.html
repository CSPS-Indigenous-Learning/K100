	<h2>Rise of tuberculosis</h2>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
	<p>In the 1800s, the loss of hunting grounds, the bison slaughter, military invasions and forced relocation caused poverty, malnutrition and famine in Indigenous communities. Diseases such as small pox weakened the Indigenous populations and tuberculosis rates soared which resulted in a medical crisis within communities. </p>
	<p>At various times, fears about “Indian tuberculosis” reached near-hysterical levels when medical experts claimed that <strong>infection rates were 10 to 20 times higher</strong> than the rates in non-Indigenous communities.</p>
	<h2>Forced treatment</h2>
	<p>In the early 1950s, the Government of Canada passed laws that gave police and medical authorities the power to seize, examine and treat Indians who had infectious diseases. If they refused medical treatment, Indigenous peoples faced fines and imprisonment.</p>
	<p>Evidence exists to suggest that Indigenous people’s medical treatment included the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Indigenous worldviews and cultural practices were undermined</li>
		<li> Indigenous peoples were denied contact with Elders and traditional healers</li>
		<li> New drugs, vaccinations and surgeries were tested on First Nations, Métis, and Inuit without their knowledge or permission</li>
		<li> An unknown number of Indigenous women were sterilized without their consent and against their wishes</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Indigenous people infected by tuberculosis were brought to <a href="#glossarySanatorium" class="csps-glossary" data-effect="mfp-zoom-in">sanitariums</a> that were far away from home. Some of them passed away and their bodies were never returned to their communities. Many families, especially in Inuit communities in the Far North, were never even notified of the deaths of community members.</p>
