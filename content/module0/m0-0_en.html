	<h1>The Uncomfortable Truth</h1>
	<p>This course looks at key historical moments of the relationship between the Government of Canada and Indigenous peoples. It presents stories that will show you a renewed perspective of what Indigenous peoples experienced in the past and how this history continues to affect individuals, families, communities, society and cultures today.</p>
	<p>It is crucial to develop your knowledge about key <strong>historical </strong>events to help you understand the<strong> relationships, old and new, </strong>between the Government of Canada and Indigenous peoples. When we recognize the impacts of history on First Nations, Métis and Inuit, we have a better understanding of the sensitivity and respectful actions needed when collaborating together. This is the next step in developing <a href="#glossaryCulturalCompetency" class="csps-glossary" data-effect="mfp-zoom-in">cultural competency</a>.</p>
