  <p>The <strong>Sixties Scoop</strong> refers to "scooping up" Indigenous children from their families and communities to place in foster homes or for adoptionâ€”without notification or consent.</p>
  <p>The practice began in the late 1950s after the Government of Canada transferred responsibility for child welfare to the provinces. It persisted into the 1980s, when legislation was changed to make the practice no longer possible.</p>
  <p>Each province had different foster programs and adoption policies. The criteria for removing the children were never clear. Parents and children did not know why the children were taken away but everyone was left with the feeling and belief that because they were Indigenous, they were <strong>bad and unworthy people</strong>.</p>
  <p>Most Indigenous children were placed in foster care or for adoption in Canada, but some were placed in the United States or Western Europe.</p>

  <h2>Effects of displacement</h2>
  <div class="sidebox x-large smaller-font">
    <p>The effects of the Sixties Scoop are long-lasting and considerable:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> loss of language, culture and traditional ways of life</li>
      <li> low self-esteem</li>
      <li> feelings of shame, guilt, loneliness and confusion</li>
      <li> poor mental health</li>
      <li> suicide</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>Since birth records could not be opened unless both the child and the parent consented, many adoptees learned about their true heritage only later in life. This caused <strong>frustration</strong> and <strong>emotional distress</strong>. Some Sixties Scoop survivors are still searching for their families today. As a result, <a href='#' data-ext="wb-ext-11" class="external">class-action lawsuits</a> against provincial governments are being pursued.</p>
