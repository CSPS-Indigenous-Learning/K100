	<h1>Alarming statistics</h1>

<div class="col-md-5">
	<p>Indigenous women and girls are three times more likely to be assaulted and victims of violence than non-Indigenous women. Indigenous women represent only 4.3% of the Canadian female population, but the homicide rates are at 16%. </p>
	<blockquote><strong>The high numbers of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in our country is alarming.</strong></blockquote>
	<p>To understand these statistics, we need to examine the links between violence, colonialism and the broader social issues that shape how we view Indigenous peoples. The Native Women&rsquo;s Association of Canada has a fact sheet showing the <a href='#' data-ext="wb-ext-12" class="external">root causes of violence against Indigenous women</a>. Many can be directly linked to the Indian Residential School system, the Sixties Scoop and the current child welfare system.</p>

	<p><a href='#' data-ext="wb-ext-13" class="external">Sisters in Spirit</a> is a research, education and policy initiative that began in 2005. It works to raise awareness and gather statistical information on violence against Indigenous women. Funded by Status of Women Canada, Sisters in Spirit works closely with families to ensure their voices and stories are told.</p>
	<h2>National Inquiry</h2>
	<p>The Government of Canada has made addressing the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and <a href="#glossaryTwoSpirit" class="csps-glossary" data-effect="mfp-zoom-in">Two-Spirit people</a> a priority. In 2016, a <a href='#' data-ext="wb-ext-14" class="external">National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls</a> was launched. The inquiry plays an important role in bringing justice to <strong>all</strong> of the victims and families. </p>
