  <h1>Examples of inequities for Indigenous Peoples</h1>
  <p>Through your work, personal life or the media, you may be aware of differences in health and social status between Indigenous people and non-Indigenous people in our country. These differences have increased over time and have a significant impact on the well-being of First Nations, Métis and Inuit.</p>
  <p>The following table highlights some of the differences between the lived realities of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. It uses Statistics Canada data from the Census in 2011 and 2016.</p>
