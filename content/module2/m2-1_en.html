	<h2>British North America Act</h2>
	<img class="pull-right" src="content/medias/images/Canadian_Coat_of_Arms-01.png" alt="Canadian Coat of Arms">
	<p><em>The British North America Act</em> gave the Government of Canada jurisdiction over &ldquo;Indians and Land reserved for Indians&rdquo; in Canada. This meant that it was the Government of Canada’s responsibility to take care of the &ldquo;Indians&rdquo;, and not that of the provinces. Under this <em>Act</em>’s authority, the <em>Indian Act</em> was created in 1876.</p>
	<h2>Indian Act</h2>
	<p>Following Confederation, the Government of Canada found itself responsible for &ldquo;Indians and Land reserved for Indians&rdquo;. To accomplish the goal of nation building, it was decided that <strong>legislation was required to govern &ldquo;Indians&rdquo;.</strong></p>
	<p>The <em>Indian Act</em> was created by combining legislation used within provinces and territories. This <em>Act</em> provided a legal framework that permitted the Government of Canada to control the lives of First Nations people <strong>socially, economically, politically and institutionally</strong>. It used mechanisms such as: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Indian status</li>
		<li>access to rights</li>
		<li>access to land</li>
		<li>resources</li>
		<li>education</li>
		<li>band administration</li>
	</ul>
	<p><strong>Métis and Inuit are excluded from the <em>Indian Act</em>.</strong></p>
	<p>Since 1876, there have been multiple amendments to this <em>Act</em>, which have <strong>increased the imbalance of power</strong> between First Nations and the Government of Canada.</p>
