	<h1>Violence against Indigenous women and girls</h1>

<div class="col-md-6">
	<p>Indigenous women and girls are among the most vulnerable populations in Canadian society today. The impacts of colonialism &mdash;&nbsp;disruption of families and communities, loss of land, language and culture&nbsp;&mdash; affect them in disproportionate ways.</p>
	<p>Before Europeans arrived, Indigenous women had an essential and distinct role in society as caretakers of the land and communities. Because of this central role, colonial authorities and settlers had to remove the women from the land, since they were often a central component of social structures and governance.</p>
	<p>The <em>Indian Act</em> legitimized the <strong>removal of women from their communities and disrupted traditional structures</strong>, allowing the Government of Canada to gain control over land, resources and people more easily. Through disempowerment, displacement and disenfranchisement, Indigenous women became <strong>objectified and targeted for violence</strong>. For example, an Indigenous woman who married a non-Indigenous man would lose her status and have to leave her community. However, when an Indigenous man married a non-indigenous woman, she would gain status.</p>
