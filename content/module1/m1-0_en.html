			<p>Some people think that the history of Indigenous peoples started with the arrival of the Europeans. That’s not true at all!</p>
			<p>Indigenous peoples living here were self-sufficient and had advanced civilizations. Hundreds of distinct nations existed with their own communities, governing structures, architecture and housing, justice systems and spiritual practices. The arrival of Europeans had a lasting negative impact on Indigenous peoples. Even so, many communities have kept their traditions, cultures and languages alive. Many others are learning them again.</p>
			<p>Indigenous peoples remember their history mainly through <strong>oral tradition.</strong> This tradition has proven to be as reliable as other methods of recording history. Evidence from Inuit oral history was recently used to find HMS Terror and HMS Erebus from <a data-ext="wb-ext-0" href="#">Sir John Franklin’s expedition</a> in 1845. Eyewitness accounts of what happened, passed down from generation to generation, played an important part in the discovery.</p>

			Many different Indigenous languages existed in North America. The following map provides an overview of this diversity—though the language areas were less separate than this map suggests. The lands and language groups of the Indigenous nations spread across the current borders of Canada and the United States.</p><a class="wb-lbx" href="content/medias/images/Langs_N.Amer.png"><img alt="Map delineates each language family in a unique color." class="img-responsive" src="content/medias/images/Langs_N.Amer.png" title="source:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Langs_N.Amer.png"></a>

			<p>Indigenous peoples had their own governance structures before they began making treaties with the Europeans. They also had trade agreements among themselves to share the land:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>In 1450, the Haudenosaunee Confederacy in the lower Great Lakes region, with Dekanahwideh (the Peacemaker) and Hiawatha, created the Great Law of Peace to resolve disputes among Iroquois tribes</li>
				<li>The Anishinaabe and the Haudenosaunee made a treaty called the “Dish With One Spoon,” which bound both parties to share and protect the land</li>
				<li>The Blackfoot Confederacy joined the Blackfoot, Blood and Piegan tribes located in the Great Plains region of Canada and the United States, who shared a common nomadic lifestyle based on hunting bison</li>

		<p>Europeans first arrived in the eastern regions. Some established partnerships with Indigenous peoples, whose traditional knowledge they depended on for survival. They exchanged services and products based on a mutually beneficial relationship.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Europeans supplied manufactured goods and items such as firearms</li>
			<li>Indigenous peoples provided food, survival skills, knowledge of the land and water, and access to furs</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Over time this relationship changed. Here are three factors that influenced this change: the Doctrine of Discovery and <em>terra nullius</em>, European economic desires, and the spread of European conflict.</p>
		<h3>Doctrine of Discovery</h3>
		<p>The <strong>Doctrine of Discovery</strong> and <em>terra nullius</em>, which in Latin means “nobody’s land,” enabled European nations to take land and resources for themselves. Introduced by Pope Alexander VI in 1493, the doctrine was expanded to include lands not occupied by ‘’civilized’’ peoples, or not being put to ‘’civilized’’ use. In the eyes of the European colonizing nations, Indigenous peoples were not using the land in a civilized way. You will learn more about Indigenous peoples’ connection to the land in Chapter 4: Talking about the land.</p>
		<p class="circle-bundle journal col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-2 col-md-12 col-md-offset-0"><strong>Self-reflection: Why is it problematic that Europeans said that Indigenous people were not “civilized”? How do you think this has influenced current stereotypes and prejudices towards Indigenous peoples today?</strong></p>
		<p>The economic desire for resources such as timber, gold and furs led Europeans to focus on building a strong presence throughout the continent. Their settlements gradually spread from the Atlantic region all the way to the West Coast. Europeans also looked to the North where fishing and whaling resources were abundant and profitable.</p>
		<h3>European conflicts</h3>
		<p>Europeans brought their conflicts from Europe to North America, and wars being fought between European powers included battles here. To improve their chances of success and bolster their own forces, Europeans created alliances with local Indigenous peoples, who had vast knowledge of the land and refined warfare tactics. Indigenous peoples were drawn into wars not of their making and were used to further the objectives of the Europeans.</p>
		<p>During this period, Indigenous populations outnumbered Europeans living on the continent. As time passed, the impact of war, diseases, and disruption of traditional lifestyles caused famine and social disorder. Indigenous populations began to decrease.</p>

		<h2 class="modal-title">Elimination</h2>
	</header>
	<div class="modal-body">
		<p>Indigenous peoples were often viewed as a barrier to colonial development that needed to be eliminated. Colonial authorities in what is now Canada wanted more land. They believed in privatizing the land and extracting resources from it—they didn’t think it was necessary to consider the world views and interests of Indigenous peoples. As more and more Europeans settled, local Indigenous populations were pushed off of their traditional territories to make room for colonial economic expansion.</p>
		<p>European religions spread aggressively across the country. These religions were brought in by missionaries who wanted to Christianize the Indigenous peoples and replace their spiritual practices. This led to a great loss of knowledge and spiritual guidance for many Indigenous peoples, and left them doubting their place in the world.</p>

			<p>Following Confederation, the Government of Canada took very distinct and targeted actions to assimilate Indigenous peoples. These actions included:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> establishing Indian Residential Schools</li>
				<li> forcing <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="wb-ext-2">enfranchisement</a> of individuals</li>
				<li> implementing the <em>Indian Act</em></li>
				<li> forcing Inuit relocations</li>
				<li> constant displacement of Métis</li>
				<li> the Sixties Scoop</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Sadly, these techniques of assimilation lasted for over 150 years, and some are still ongoing. The legacies of these and other actions continue to have major impacts on First Nations, Métis and Inuit communities and individuals across the country. </p>

	<div class="modal-body">
		<p>Before and after Confederation in 1867, the <a href="#" data-ext="wb-ext-3">Crown</a> and Indigenous peoples negotiated a number of treaties. Many promises were made, but they were not always respected. In 1982, the Constitution of Canada was amended to confirm the existence and protection of Aboriginal and treaty rights.</p>
		<p>The Government of Canada recognized that these rights included the inherent right to <a class="external" href="#" data-ext="wb-ext-4">self-government</a>. Unfortunately, the Government has been slow to change its ways of thinking and acting. In the last decade, many Indigenous communities have fought for their rights to be acknowledged and recognized through the courts. The court decisions are moving the Government of Canada and public service employees in a new direction. A direction of reconciliation!</p>

		<p>This period of history is just beginning. Many apologies have been made to Indigenous peoples for the harm that has been done to them. We know, however, that apologizing isn’t enough. The Government of Canada, including all public service employees, is committed to reconciliation and needs to take meaningful actions towards it.
