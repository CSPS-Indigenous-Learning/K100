         <p begin="00:00:09.83" end="00:00:13.00">Reconciliation is about atonement.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:13.00" end="00:00:14.95">It&apos;s about making amends.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:14.95" end="00:00:16.70">It&apos;s about apology.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:16.70" end="00:00:19.33">It&apos;s about recognizing responsibility.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:19.33" end="00:00:22.04">It&apos;s about accounting for what has gone on.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:22.04" end="00:00:26.16">But ultimately, it&apos;s about commitment to maintaining that</p>
         <p begin="00:00:26.16" end="00:00:30.33">mutually respectful relationship throughout, recognizing that,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:30.33" end="00:00:34.37">even when you establish it, there will be challenges to it.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:34.37" end="00:00:39.87">From the perspective of survivors, wanting Canada,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:39.87" end="00:00:44.45">the people of Canada, to acknowledge the wrong,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:44.45" end="00:00:48.75">to atone for it and to amend their ways,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:48.75" end="00:00:51.91">I think it&apos;s fair to say that they&apos;re probably</p>
         <p begin="00:00:51.91" end="00:00:55.87">quite pleased with the reaction to the TRC&apos;s report,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:55.87" end="00:00:58.16">hopeful that in fact things will change,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:58.16" end="00:00:60.29">but we&apos;re still too early in that change process</p>
         <p begin="00:00:60.29" end="00:00:62.20">to be able to say it&apos;s going to happen.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:62.20" end="00:00:66.12">For public servants, what&apos;s important is to understand,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:66.12" end="00:00:69.12">when the government makes a commitment like they have</p>
         <p begin="00:00:69.12" end="00:00:72.37">done to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights</p>
         <p begin="00:00:72.37" end="00:00:75.70">of Indigenous Peoples or to establishing a</p>
         <p begin="00:00:75.70" end="00:00:77.87">Nation-to-Nation relationship...</p>
         <p begin="00:00:77.87" end="00:00:81.00">Understanding what that means and what that means</p>
         <p begin="00:00:81.00" end="00:00:83.41">to government policy, government actions and</p>
         <p begin="00:00:83.41" end="00:00:85.70">government programs is very key.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:85.70" end="00:00:88.08">There are a number of things that public servants need to</p>
         <p begin="00:00:88.08" end="00:00:90.75">be aware of in order for us to have a better relationship.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:90.75" end="00:00:94.62">We need to be aware of the fact that a lot of the social</p>
         <p begin="00:00:94.62" end="00:00:97.25">problems that young people are presenting to the Canadian</p>
         <p begin="00:00:97.25" end="00:00:100.37">justice system, to the child welfare system and to Canadian</p>
         <p begin="00:00:100.37" end="00:00:104.20">society generally are a legacy of residential schools,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:104.20" end="00:00:107.08">are a legacy of the Canadian government&apos;s policy</p>
         <p begin="00:00:107.08" end="00:00:108.91">towards Indigenous people.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:108.91" end="00:00:113.41">So, from the perspective of the public service,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:113.41" end="00:00:115.08">they need to know that history.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:115.08" end="00:00:118.66">They need to know that that&apos;s part of the equation of</p>
         <p begin="00:00:118.66" end="00:00:121.50">discussion that they&apos;re going to encounter when it comes</p>
         <p begin="00:00:121.50" end="00:00:126.25">to Indigenous people, talking to them, dealing with them.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:126.25" end="00:00:129.70">In particular, the young Indigenous population today</p>
         <p begin="00:00:129.70" end="00:00:134.16">will still trot out the history of residential schools as</p>
         <p begin="00:00:134.16" end="00:00:139.75">a basis for claiming that more needs to be done.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:139.75" end="00:00:141.58">But more does need to be done.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:141.58" end="00:00:143.04">We mustn&apos;t forget that.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:143.04" end="00:00:144.95">Language programs need to be established to</p>
         <p begin="00:00:144.95" end="00:00:147.37">allow Indigenous people to recover their language.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:147.37" end="00:00:149.62">Culture revival programs are very important</p>
         <p begin="00:00:149.62" end="00:00:153.58">to Indigenous youth, survivors of residential schools and</p>
         <p begin="00:00:153.58" end="00:00:157.00">survivors of those survivors.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:157.00" end="00:00:159.50">They want to look at ways that they can bring their culture</p>
         <p begin="00:00:159.50" end="00:00:161.66">back so they can live in accordance with the teachings</p>
         <p begin="00:00:161.66" end="00:00:165.33">of their ancestors.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:165.33" end="00:00:168.04">Cultural revival is not something that&apos;s funded</p>
         <p begin="00:00:168.04" end="00:00:171.54">by existing program dollars in a significant way.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:171.54" end="00:00:174.29">It needs to be acknowledged as valid.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:174.29" end="00:00:176.79">It&apos;s in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of</p>
         <p begin="00:00:176.79" end="00:00:181.33">Indigenous Peoples, which Canada is now a full signature to.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:181.33" end="00:00:185.29">Figuring out a way to make all of that happen</p>
         <p begin="00:00:185.29" end="00:00:190.79">in a cohesive, coherent manner is very important.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:190.79" end="00:00:194.33">The Canadian public believes that something needs to be done</p>
         <p begin="00:00:194.33" end="00:00:197.70">because of this history of residential schools and cultural</p>
         <p begin="00:00:197.70" end="00:00:199.66">oppression since Confederation.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:199.66" end="00:00:203.54">What we want people in government to understand is,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:203.54" end="00:00:207.04">you need to be ahead of this curve or you&apos;ll be swept along</p>
         <p begin="00:00:207.04" end="00:00:211.29">with it and you will be responding to public demands</p>
         <p begin="00:00:211.29" end="00:00:214.41">and public criticism, sometimes in a way that&apos;s inappropriate</p>
         <p begin="00:00:214.41" end="00:00:216.95">if you haven&apos;t given careful planning to what</p>
         <p begin="00:00:216.95" end="00:00:218.70">it is that we need to do.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:218.70" end="00:00:221.37">The Government of Canada needs to have a vision</p>
         <p begin="00:00:221.37" end="00:00:223.75">about reconciliation.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:223.75" end="00:00:226.66">It&apos;s in our report - not the fact that you need a plan,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:226.66" end="00:00:228.95">but what the vision looks like.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:228.95" end="00:00:232.12">Take this as your vision and make it happen.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:232.12" end="00:00:234.95">Recognize that it&apos;s going to take a long time.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:234.95" end="00:00:236.95">We need to be patient with ourselves.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:236.95" end="00:00:239.08">We need to recognize that we&apos;re going to stumble,</p>
         <p begin="00:00:239.08" end="00:00:242.20">we&apos;re going to make mistakes and we&apos;re going to</p>
         <p begin="00:00:242.20" end="00:00:245.25">get things wrong initially because we&apos;re going down</p>
         <p begin="00:00:245.25" end="00:00:247.33">a whole new road here.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:247.33" end="00:00:250.50">We need to stay committed.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:250.50" end="00:00:253.75">As long as our hearts are aimed in the right direction</p>
         <p begin="00:00:253.75" end="00:00:257.79">and we&apos;re moving in the right way, we&apos;ll get there.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:257.79" end="00:00:263.25">Understanding why Indigenous people are suffering or are</p>
         <p begin="00:00:263.25" end="00:00:268.66">complaining about the treatment at the hands of the public</p>
         <p begin="00:00:268.66" end="00:00:273.54">or the Canadian government or by provincial governments of their</p>
         <p begin="00:00:273.54" end="00:00:277.54">sense of rights is something that many public servants</p>
         <p begin="00:00:277.54" end="00:00:279.83">still need some work to understand.</p>
         <p begin="00:00:279.83" end="00:00:284.16">If I could provide them with the opportunity to feel</p>
         <p begin="00:00:284.16" end="00:00:288.00">that at their inner core, that&apos;s what I would give them</p>
         <p begin="00:00:288.00" end="00:00:289.83">as a Christmas gift.</p>
