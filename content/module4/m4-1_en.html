    <p>Treaty making has existed for a long time and is not an exclusively European concept. As mentioned above in the historic overview, the Dish with One Spoon is a great example of a treaty between three nations. </p>
    <p><a href='#' data-ext="wb-ext-16" class="external">Treaties</a> are negotiated agreements that define the rights, responsibilities and relationships between a First Nations, Métis or Inuit community and a federal or provincial government. They are still seen by many First Nations, Métis and Inuit as a <strong>sacred agreement</strong> that has as much relevance in today’s context as it did when it was initially signed.</p>

    <p class="sidebox medium">Every treaty is different and reflects the concerns and desires of the particular parties at the time they were signed. No one treaty can be looked at to define what rights and entitlements exist.</p>

            <p>&lsquo;Treaty&rdquo; in Cree is &lsquo;Naskumituwin&rsquo;, an oral agreement.</p>
            <p>And our agreements were always spoken.</p>
            <p>For George Spence, the core of treaty was &lsquo;wiichihiiwaawin&rsquo;.</p>
            <p>To help one another.</p>
            <p>And so, we the commissioners--</p>
            <p>He was there for the making of Treaty Nine, where the Cree were told-- We will honour this agreement together, for as long as the sun shines and the waters flow.</p>
            <p>The Cree made their mark because they were assured that the land would be shared, and they would always be able to harvest what they needed.</p>
            <p>George Spence was my great-grandfather.</p>
            <p>In his life, he saw many promises of the Treaty go unfulfilled.</p>
            <p>Treaties were essential to the creation of Canada.</p>
            <p>First Nations still fight for the agreements to be honoured.</p>
