<h1>Chapter 2: Canadian political framework</h1>
<p>This chapter looks at a few key pieces of legislation that have shaped the relationship between the Government of Canada and Indigenous peoples. These documents, among others, still have a <strong>significant impact</strong> on Indigenous peoples today.</p>
<h2>Royal Proclamation</h2>
<p>In 1763, King George III of England issued a Royal Proclamation to set out specific guidelines for settlers. It acknowledged that Indigenous peoples:</p>
<ul>
	<li> existed before the arrival of Europeans</li>
	<li> never ceded or sold the land to the Crown</li>
	<li> were free to live on the land undisturbed according to their traditions</li>
</ul>
<p>The Proclamation also set out the ways in which governments could negotiate treaties on lands inhabited by “Indians.” In doing so, it officially recognized that these lands were those of Indigenous peoples. This recognition is confirmed in the <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em>.</p>
<p>Essentially, the Proclamation considered First Nations, and later Métis and Inuit, to be political entities capable of having treaty relations with the Crown. <strong>Unfortunately, this view was not honoured.</strong></p>
