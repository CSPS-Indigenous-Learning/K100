<h1>Truth and Reconciliation Commission</h1>
<div class="col-md-6">
    <p>In the 1980s, former residential school students started to take legal action. In 2007, the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement recognized the damage inflicted on Indigenous peoples. It was the largest class action settlement in Canadian history to date.</p>
    <p>In 2008, the Prime Minister of Canada provided a <a href='#' data-ext="wb-ext-9" class="external">Statement of apology to former students of Indian Residential Schools</a>, stating:</p>
    <blockquote class="h5" align="center"><strong>&ldquo;The government now recognizes that the consequences of the Indian Residential Schools policy has had a lasting and damaging impact on Aboriginal culture, heritage and languageâ€¦.The legacy of Indian Residential Schools has contributed to social problems that continue to exist in many communities today.&rdquo;</strong></blockquote>
    <p>In 2015, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission issued its report.</p>
    <p>It identified 94 Calls to Action to &ldquo;redress the legacy of residential schools and advance the process of Canadian reconciliation.&rdquo; We invite you to take some time to read the report and the Calls to Action: <a href='#' data-ext="wb-ext-10" class="external">Truth and Reconciliation Commission Report</a>. <strong>Try to identify key actions you can undertake, personally and professionally, to make a difference for our country</strong>.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I can confirm that they are still excavating remains of children of the Residential School, the Mohawk Institute, near my reserve (Six Nations). Some children never came home and were given no answers.&rdquo; <footer>Samantha White, First Nations student</footer></p>

    <p>The Indian Residential School system is now considered by many, including <a href="#" class="external" data-ext="wb-ext-29">Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin</a>, to be a form of <a href="#glossaryCulturalGenocide" class="csps-glossary" data-effect="mfp-zoom-in">cultural genocide</a>. As explained in the TRC report, the intent was to: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>eradicate all aspects of Indigenous culture in the young people</li>
        <li>interrupt the transmission of this culture from one generation to the next</li>
