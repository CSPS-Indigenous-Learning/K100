<h1>Duty to consult and accommodate</h1>
<p>Because of section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, public service employees have a <a href="#glossaryDutyToConsult" class="csps-glossary" data-effect="mfp-zoom-in">duty to consult and accommodate</a> regarding any activity that could interfere with Indigenous right.</p></div>


<div class="col-md-7"><h2>Reactive versus proactive</h2>
<p>Prior to the Supreme Court case <a href="#" data-ext="wb-ext-5" class="external">Haida Nation v. British Columbia (Minister of Forests)</a> in 2004, it was considered ‘’acceptable’’ to take a <strong>reactive</strong> approach to Indigenous rights and title claims. Once a project was in place, the Government of Canada would review any complaints it received and react as fit. This period is known as <strong>pre-Haida</strong>.</p>
<p>Since the 2004 Supreme Court case, or <strong>post-Haida</strong>, a reactive approach is no longer acceptable. The Government of Canada must be proactive. This means that as employees of the Government of Canada we must:</p>
<li> <strong>consult</strong> with Indigenous communities whenever Indigenous rights or title could be impacted</li>
<li> be <strong>proactive</strong> in working with First Nations, Métis and Inuit before planning, developing, implementing and monitoring anything that could affect their rights</li>
<li> go out and <strong>listen</strong> to what First Nations, Métis and Inuit communities want and need</li>
<li> <strong>work collaboratively</strong> with Indigenous peoples in developing new policies, programs and services <p></p>
	<p><strong>The courts will not be in a position to support government initiatives if consultation has not taken place in good faith.</strong>
	</p>
</li>
<p>As a public service employee, much of what you do has a direct or indirect impact on the rights of First Nations, Métis or Inuit—especially in developing legislation, policies, operational procedures, or services.</p>
