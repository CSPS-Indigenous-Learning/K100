		<summary>Treaty rights</summary>
		<p><strong>A treaty is a solemn agreement between the Crown and an Indigenous group</strong> that sets out promises, obligations and benefits for both parties. Section 35.1 of the <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em> defines treaty rights as including “rights that now exist by way of land claims agreements or may be so acquired.”</p>
	</details>
	<details>
		<summary>Aboriginal rights</summary>
		<p>These are <strong>rights around a practice</strong>, custom or tradition that was part of a distinctive Indigenous culture before European contact. It includes the use and management of lands and natural resources - for example, for <strong>fishing, hunting and harvesting</strong>. It also includes the rights to cultural protection and meaningful implementation of treaties.</p>
		<p>For the <strong>Métis</strong>, this means a practice, custom or tradition that was an integral part of the distinctive culture of the historic Métis community at the date of effective European control.</p>
	</details>
	<details>
		<summary>Aboriginal title</summary>
		<p>Aboriginal title recognizes an Indigenous group’s collective interest in a specific territory based on long-standing use and occupancy of the land. That said, the Government of Canada and other third parties should be <strong>collaborating and consulting</strong> with Indigenous communities prior to making decisions on the use of land.</p>
		<p>The <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em> does not define the full set of Aboriginal rights. These rights are <strong>continuously being clarified and articulated </strong>through historic and Modern Treaties, self-government agreements and court cases.</p>
