<div class="col-md-6">
	<p>In the beginning, the Department of Indian Affairs denied any legal obligation to provide health care to First Nations, Métis and Inuit. Instead, the Department funded segregated services to medical facilities run by the Churches. The aim was to reduce costs and confine disease within communities and isolated areas.</p>
	<p>After a number of health crises on reserves and in the North, the Government of Canada introduced the <a href="#glossaryNIHB" class="csps-glossary" data-effect="mfp-zoom-in">Non-insured Health Benefit Program</a>. It provides registered First Nations and recognized Inuit with a specified range of medical items and services. The program has faced significant criticism for not being sufficiently funded to cover the real needs of First Nations and Inuit. </p>
