<h1>Outcomes and inequities</h1>
<p>The impact on people who survive this kind of traumatic experience is profound, yet it does not end with the individual. Colonization has contributed directly and indirectly to <strong>the loss of:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li> languages</li>
	<li> access to traditional territory</li>
	<li> access to traditional foods and medicines</li>
	<li> traditional roles and governance</li>
	<li> traditional knowledge</li>
	<li> cultural and spiritual practices</li>
	<li> families and communities</li>
	<li> sense of cultural identify</li>
	<li> 90% of the population</li>
	<li> the privilege to grow up in a society free of racism</li>
</ul>
<p>Traumatic experience has a profound impact on the individuals who survive it. These impacts are far-reaching and intergenerationalâ€”families and communities suffer as well. The most common mental and psychological outcomes are substance abuse, addictions, suicide, self-harming behaviours, dissociation (inability to feel) and re-enactment through risk-taking and abuse.</p>
