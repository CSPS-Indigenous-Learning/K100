	<h1>Chapter 4: Talking about the land</h1>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
	<p>First Nations, Métis and Inuit share a profound connection to the land. Chapter 4 explores this sacred relationship and how it impacts treaties and agreements with Indigenous peoples.</p>
	<blockquote class="h5" align="center"><strong>The land is not owned, nor does it belong to any one person.</strong></blockquote>
	<h2>A sacred relationship</h2>
	<p>Connection with the land is a sacred relationship for Indigenous peoples. Like a mother provides for her children, the earth gives us food, water and shelter—everything we need to survive and more. In return, we have a responsibility to take care of Mother Earth.</p>
	<p>From this perspective, the land is not an object. The land is a living entity that guides our health and well-being—mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually.</p> When <strong>Mother Earth</strong> is sick, we are sick. <p>Environmentalists advocate that caring for the earth is not just the responsibility of Indigenous peoples. It is the responsibility of all humans around the world. <strong>The earth can survive without us, but we cannot survive without the earth. </strong>If we don’t take care of our environment, future generations will suffer. </p>
	<p>The land can also mean different things to different Indigenous communities and people. For example, a person who is Plains Cree will have a different understanding of the land than an Inuk, based on differing world views and landscapes.</p>
	<p>As public service employees, we need to respect this sacred connection to the land—even if we do not understand it.</p>
